# Theory of Change and Impact Pathway: Activities, Outputs, Outcomes, and Impacts

In **Theory of Change (ToC)** and related frameworks like **impact pathway** approaches (commonly used in program planning, monitoring, and evaluation, especially in development, research, and social interventions), the terms **activities**, **outputs**, **outcomes**, and **impacts** describe a logical sequence of how interventions lead to change. These form a causal chain: interventions produce immediate results, which lead to intermediate changes, and ultimately to broader, longer-term effects.

## Activities
These are the actions, processes, or initiatives undertaken using available resources (inputs like funding, staff, or materials).  

Activities represent **"what you do"** to implement the program.  

**Examples**:  
- Conducting training workshops  
- Distributing resources  
- Running awareness campaigns  
- Researching and developing tools  

## Outputs
These are the direct, tangible products or deliverables that result immediately from the activities.  

Outputs are typically quantifiable and under the program's control—they measure completion or delivery rather than change.  

**Examples**:  
- Number of workshops held  
- Materials distributed (e.g., seeds to farmers)  
- People trained  
- Reports produced  
- Tools developed  

Outputs often have a one-to-one link with activities and are short-term.

## Outcomes
These are the short- to medium-term changes or benefits resulting from the use or application of outputs.  

Outcomes focus on behavioral, knowledge, attitude, skill, or condition changes among beneficiaries or stakeholders (e.g., individuals, organizations, or communities).  

They represent the **"so what?"**—the effects or uptake of outputs.  

**Examples**:  
- Improved knowledge or skills from training  
- Changed practices (e.g., farmers adopting new techniques)  
- Increased awareness  
- Better policies adopted  

Outcomes are often observable within months to a few years and may require contributions from external factors.

## Impacts
These are the long-term, broader effects or ultimate changes on society, the environment, economy, or well-being.  

Impacts are the highest-level goals, often occurring years later and influenced by multiple factors beyond the program alone.  

They can be positive/negative, intended/unintended.  

**Examples**:  
- Reduced poverty  
- Improved health or education levels  
- Environmental sustainability  
- Systemic changes like lower unemployment rates  

Impacts are harder to attribute directly to one intervention and focus on sustained, wider-scale transformation.

## Key Notes
- The sequence is often depicted as: **Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Impacts** (inputs are sometimes included at the start).
- Theory of Change emphasizes the **"why"** and assumptions behind these links (causal pathways), while similar tools like logical frameworks (logframes) are more linear and focused on planning/monitoring.
- **Impact pathway** theory (used in research-for-development) follows a similar chain but stresses how outputs are adopted to create outcomes and contribute to impacts.
- Distinguishing **outputs** from **outcomes** is crucial: Outputs are about **delivery**; outcomes are about **change** resulting from that delivery.

This framework helps map how interventions create change, identify assumptions, and guide measurement.
